//  Completeness

//  Created by Gustavo Ferreira Bassani on 10/09/25.
//
///  This file centralizes custom extensions used across the app.
///  Extensions are added to:
///  - Provide convenience methods
///  - Improve code readability
///  - Reuse common logic
///
///  Keep extensions organized by type (e.g., String, Date, UIColor)
///  and avoid mixing unrelated responsibilities in the same block.
