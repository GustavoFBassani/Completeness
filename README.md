App-Challenge 2 
ðŸ§± Architecture
This project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture:
Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
View: Handles the UI, focusing only on presentation and user interaction.
ViewModel: Acts as the bridge between the Model and the View. It exposes the data in a way the View can easily consume, and it manages the interaction logic without being tied to UI components.
This separation promotes better testability, scalability, and maintainability by reducing the responsibilities of the View and keeping business logic out of UI code.
